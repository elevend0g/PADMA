# PADMA

## Personal Automated Data Management Assistant

PADMA is an AI agent framework designed to help individuals with ADHD and executive function challenges by creating a personalized, privacy-focused cognitive support system.

## Project Vision

PADMA aims to fill in the gaps in executive function by:
- Tracking appointments and tasks
- Managing communications
- Organizing information
- Evolving to understand personal patterns and needs

The system is designed with a focus on privacy, keeping personal data local while leveraging AI capabilities.

## Core Architecture

PADMA is structured as a multi-agent system:

- **PADMA Prime**: Executive function and planning
- **PADMA Sentinel**: Information processing and monitoring
- **PADMA Executor**: Task execution and system interaction

These agents work together to provide comprehensive support while maintaining the ability to operate independently when needed.

## Technical Foundation

- **Knowledge Graph**: Neo4j-based graph database with dynamic schema evolution
- **Memory Systems**: Multiple memory types (episodic, procedural, semantic)
- **Local-First Processing**: Designed to keep data private and secure
- **Communication**: Integrates with existing platforms (RocketChat, Matrix)
- **Implementation**: Python-based with Conda environments

## Key Features

- **Contextual Awareness**: Understands relationships between information
- **Adaptive Learning**: Grows more effective over time
- **Multi-Platform Communication**: Interacts through preferred channels
- **Knowledge Exploration**: Connects ideas and information
- **Privacy-Centered**: Keeps sensitive information under user control

## Development Approach

The project follows a phased implementation:

1. **Bootstrap Phase**: API-backed initial instance
2. **Expansion Phase**: Deployment across multiple machines
3. **Learning Phase**: Building autonomous capabilities
4. **Integration Phase**: Connecting to external systems

## Getting Started

*Coming soon - Development is currently in initial planning stages*

## Project Status

This project is in early development. Current focus areas:
- Initial API integration with Claude
- Basic knowledge graph implementation
- Communication interface setup
- Bootstrap capabilities

## Contributions

This is a personal project, but suggestions and ideas are welcome through issues.
